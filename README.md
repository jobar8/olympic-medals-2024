# Olympic Medals 2024

-----

## Description

This is the repository of the Python code behind the "Medal Table Paris 2024" Streamlit app.

The app gives the user the ability to change the way rankings are calculated by using weights for
each type of medals.

## Additional information

This is my first Streamlit app and I used this project to learn more about Streamlit and sharing apps.

The data was originally downloaded from the [Paris 2024 Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games/data) and then modified to have to correct number of gold medals
for China.
